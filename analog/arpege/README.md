# Aprege V6E - Schematic from famous french guitars
This schematic has not been provided by the manufacturer, it has been reverser engineered from an actual PCB
This is purely for information and for historical purpose - so that owners of these fine instruments may be able 
to repair or restore their instruments to their original state.
No guarantee is given whatsoever regarding the accuracy of the schematic (but I've done my best)
