# Schematic from guitar active circuit (Arpege V6E)

This schematic has not been provided by the manufacturer, it has been reverser engineered from an actual working circuit.

This is purely for information and for historical purpose - so that owners of these fine instruments may be able to repair or restore their guitar to their original state.

I've done my best, but no guarantee is given whatsoever regarding the accuracy of the schematic. 

Note: This is still very much a work in progress.
