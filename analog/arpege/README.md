# Schematic from guitar active circuit (Arpege V6E)

This schematic has not been provided by the manufacturer, it has been reverser engineered from an actual PCB

This is purely for information and for historical purpose - so that owners of these fine instruments may be able to repair or restore their instruments to their original state.

No guarantee is given whatsoever regarding the accuracy of the schematic (but I've done my best)

Note: This is still very much a work in progress.
